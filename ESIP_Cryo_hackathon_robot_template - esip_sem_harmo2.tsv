ENVO:03000143	cryosphere	astronomical body part	An astronomical body part which is composed primarily of environmental materials in their frozen form.	https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4808-4736	The term refers collectively to the portions of the earth (i.e., a planet) where water is in solid form, including snow cover, floating ice, glaciers, ice caps, ice sheets, seasonally frozen ground and perennially frozen ground (permafrost). The Cryosphere may be divided into the cryoatmosphere, the cryohydrosphere (snow cover, glaciers, and river, lake and sea Ice) and the cryolithosphere (perennially and seasonally cryotic ground, rock glacier).   This is an Earth centric definition, other cryospheres will be considered later. Some definitions reffer to that which is sufficiently cold for pure water to freeze for at least a part of each year.  It should be noted that "Some authorities exclude the earth's atmosphere from the Earth's Cryosphere; others restrict the term Cryosphere to the regions of the earth's crust where Permafrost exists."

ENVO:00000484		 sea surface layer	A sea surface layer which is 1) not covered by ice and 2) completely surrounded by either pack ice or land and pack ice.	https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4808-4736	A polynya is a Russian term for any non-linear shaped area of open water within the ice pack. Polynyas may contain brash ice and/or be covered with new ice, nilas or young ice; submariners refer to these as skylights.   Sometimes the polynya is limited on one side by the coast and is called a shore polynya or by fast ice and is called a flaw polynya. If it recurs in the same position every year, e.g. off the mouths of big rivers, it is called a recurring polynya. A temporary small clearing in pack ice which consists of small floes and brash in continuous local movement is called an unstable polynya; an opening which is flanked by large floes and therefore appears to be relatively stable is called a stable polynya.   Polynyas range in size from relatively small to enormous. The largest polynya observed in the Antarctic was the Weddell Polynya of 1975-77, covering an area of 2x105km2.   The two main categories of polynya are sensible heat and latent heat, depending on the mechanism responsible for maintaining their presence. Latent heat polynyas are maintained by persistent katabatic winds that drain off the continent. Newly formed ice is advected away by the wind, leaving the surface ice-free and open to more ice formation. In this manner latent heat polynyas can be major sources of new ice production. Coastal polynyas are primarily of this type. Sensible heat polynyas are maintained by upwelling warm water that supplies a sufficiently large oceanic heat flux to the base of the ice to reduce its thickness, or melt it completely. These polynyas are not responsible for large quantities of new ice production. A polynya may also form by a combination of the sensible and latent heat processes.   From the remote sensing/sea ice standpoint a polynya is a hole in the ice that ordinarily wouldn't be there - except that either the wind is creating it by pushing the ice away or there is something under the ice that is warmer than its surroundings and melting the ice that would otherwise be there.	https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4808-4736	Remove old defintion: "Any enclosed water area in pack ice other than a lead ..."

In such an inversion, the surface must have a temperature below freezing, while the temperature of the atmosphere where the precipitation forms is above freezing. Alternately, if the temperature of the ground surface and glazed objects is typically near or below freezing (0C or 32F), it is necessary that the water drops be supercooled before striking. Freezing rain can sometimes occur on surfaces exposed to the air (such as tree limbs) with air temperatures slightly above freezing in strong winds. Local evaporational cooling may result in freezing. Freezing rain frequently occurs, therefore, as a transient condition between the occurrence of rain and ice pellets (sleet). When encountered by an aircraft in flight, freezing rain can cause a dangerous accretion of clear icing. In aviation weather observations, this hydrometeor is encoded ZR by NOAA.	https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4808-4736	This term exists, we're revising the definition with ESIP semantic Harmonization group, delete the old one.

Ice pellets usually bounce when hitting hard ground and make a sound upon impact. They can fall as continuous precipitation or in showers. Now internationally recognized, ice pellets includes two basically different types of precipitation, known in the United States as 1) sleet or grains of ice, generally transparent, globular, solid grains of ice that have formed from the freezing of raindrops or the refreezing of largely melted snowflakes when falling through a below-freezing layer of air near the earth's surface; and 2) small hail, generally translucent particles, consisting of snow pellets encased in a thin layer of ice. The ice layer may form either by the accretion of droplets upon the snow pellet or by the melting and refreezing of the surface of the snow pellet.	https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4808-4736					grain of ice|ice grain|sleet|small hail	envoPolar|envoCryo	http://sweetontology.net/phenAtmoPrecipitation/IcePellet			2021-04-14T18:57:18.275Z	https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4808-4736|http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4366-3088|http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3410-4655|https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0632-7576|https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0337-8610|https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2282-7215|https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2908-3327
