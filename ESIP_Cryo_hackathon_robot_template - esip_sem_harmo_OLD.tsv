ENVO:01000903			A blizzard is a severe snowstorm during which snow is transported by strong winds, sustained for several hours.	def~https://www.ec.gc.ca/meteo-weather/default.asp?lang=En&n=B8CD636F-1&def=allShow|http://www.bom.gov.au/lam/glossary/|http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Main_Page|http://www.physicalgeography.net/glossary.html|https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4808-4736	The U.S. National Weather Service specifies sustained wind or frequent gusts of 16 m per second (30 kt or 35 mi per hour) or greater, accompanied by falling and/or blowing snow, frequently reducing visibility to less than 400 m (0.25 mi or 0.4 km) for 3 hours or longer. Earlier definitions also included a condition of low temperatures, on the order of -7C (20F) or lower, or -12C (10F) or lower (severe blizzard). The name originated in the United States but it is also used in other countries. In the Antarctic the name is given to violent autumnal winds off the ice cap. In southeastern France, the cold north wind with snow is termed blizzard (see also boulbie).  Similar storms in Russian Asia are the buran and purga. In popular usage in the United States and in England, the term is often used for any heavy snowstorm accompanied by strong winds. 					boulbie|buran|purga			http://sweetontology.net/phenAtmoPrecipitation/Blizzard

ENVO:01001848	rime	frost	Water ice which 1) has a white or milky and opaque appearance, 2) has a granular texture, and 3) is formed as a result of the deposition and rapid freezing of supercooled water drops as they make contact with an exposed object.	def~https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4808-4736	Rime is denser and harder than hoarfrost, but lighter, softer, and less transparent than glaze. Rime is composed essentially of discrete ice granules and has densities as low as 0.2-0.3 g cm-3. Glaze is generally continuous but with some air pockets and has much higher densities. Factors that favor rime formation are small drop size, slow accretion, a high degree of supercooling, and rapid dissipation of latent heat of fusion. The opposite effects favor glaze formation. Both rime and glaze occur when supercooled water drops strike an object at a temperature below freezing. Such formation on terrestrial objects constitutes an ice storm; on aircraft, it is called aircraft icing (where rime is known as rime ice). Either rime or glaze may form on snow crystals, droxtals, or other ice particles in the atmosphere. When such a deposit is wholly or chiefly of rime, snow pellets result; when most or all of the deposit is glaze, ordinary hail or ice pellets result. The alternating clear and opaque layers of some hailstones represent glaze and rime, deposited under varying conditions around the growing hailstone.	com~https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4808-4736	Obsolete old definition in protege.					envoPolar	http://sweetontology.net/matrWater/Rime		('has quality' some (granular and opaque))	2020-11-18T19:59:42.028Z	https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4808-4736|http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4366-3088|http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3410-4655|https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0632-7576|https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0337-8610|https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2282-7215

They resemble snow pellets in external appearance, but are more flattened and elongated, and generally have diameters of less than 1 mm; they neither shatter nor bounce when they hit a hard surface. Descriptions of the physical structure of snow grains vary widely and include very fine, simple ice crystals; tiny, complex snow crystals; small, compact bundles of rime; and particles with a rime core and a fine glaze coating. It is agreed that snow grains usually fall in very small quantities, mostly from stratus clouds or from fog, and never in the form of a shower. 	com~https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4808-4736	Need to add a computable size constraint.	snow grain			granular snow	envoPolar	http://sweetontology.net/matrWater/SnowGrain		('has quality' some (opaque and white))|('formed as result of' some 'freezing of water into water ice')|('participates in' some 'precipitation process')	2020-11-18T20:22:03.870Z	https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4808-4736|http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4366-3088|http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3410-4655|https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0632-7576|https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0337-8610|https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2282-7215
ENVO:03000139	ice fog	fog	Fog which is composed of particles of ice.	def~https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4808-4736	The suspended particles may be partly ice crystals 20 to 100 micron in diameter, but chiefly, especially when dense, droxtals 12-20 micron in diameter. Ice fog is formed by direct freezing of supercooled water droplets with little growth directly from the vapor. It occurs at very low temperatures, and usually in clear, calm weather in high latitudes. The sun is usually visible and may cause halo phenomena or luminous pillars. Ice fog is rare at temperatures warmer than -30 °C, and increases in frequency with decreasing temperature until it is almost always present at air temperatures of -45 °C in the vicinity of a source of water vapor. Such sources are the open water of fast-flowing streams or of the sea, herds of animals, volcanoes, and especially products of combustion for heating or propulsion. At temperatures warmer than -30 °C, these sources can cause steam fog of liquid water droplets, which may turn into ice fog when cooled. 	com~https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4808-4736	In future will add computable renditions of size and temperature constraints. The synonyms of this class can be quite confusing, as they reference entities like frost (which requires a surface for deposition).
