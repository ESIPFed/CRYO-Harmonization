ice shelf	http://sweetontology.net/realmCryo/IceShelf	Class	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_00000380		"A floating ice sheet of considerable thickness showing 6 to 165 ft (2-50 m) or more above sea level, attached to the coast. An ice shelf may grow hundreds of miles out to sea.  Usually of great horizontal extent and with a level or gently undulating surface. Nourished by annual snow accumulation and also by the seaward extension of land glaciers. Limited areas may be aground. Ice shelves are much thicker than sea ice often filling embayments in the coastline of an ice sheet. Currently, nearly all ice shelves are in Antarctica, where most of the ice discharged into the ocean flows via ice shelves. The mass balance of an ice shelf may have significant components of both gain and loss at the base. The seaward edge is termed an ice front.  The calving of an ice shelf forms tabular icebergs and ice islands."	An ice mass which 1) is attached to the coast 2) at least 2 meters in thickness 3) forms where a glacier or ice mass flows down to a coastline and onto the ocean surface and 4) grows by annual snow accumulation or by the seaward extension of land glaciers.		yes																						
			http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01001534	tabular iceberg	"Sea ice terminology describing a flat-topped iceberg that has become detached from an iceshelf, ice tongue or floating tidewater glacier. Newly formed tabular icebergs have nearly vertical sides and flat tops. In the Antarctic, they may be tens of kilometers wide, up to 160 km (100 miles) long, and as much as 300 m (1000 ft) thick, with about 30 m (100 ft) exposed above the sea surface. In the Arctic, large icebergs of this type are called ice islands, but they are considerably smaller than the largest of the antarctic variety. Has synonyms tabular berg, table iceberg. Formerly called barrier iceberg."	"An ice berg which 1) has a flat upper surface, 2) is derived from an ice shelf, ice tongue, or floating tidewater glacier via detachment. "	"Synonym- ""Tabular berg"" A flat-topped iceberg that shows horizontal banding; typically form by breaking from an ice shelf."	Yes	subclass of iceberg in Envo; no term for tabular																					
				ice island	"1. In the Arctic the sea ice term ""ice island"" describes a large piece of floating ice protruding about 16 ft (5 m) above sea level, which has broken away from an Arctic ice shelf. Ice islands have a thickness of 30 - 50 meters (33 to 55 yards), and an area of a few thousand square metres up to 500 square kilometers (123,550 acres) or more. They are usually characterized by a regularly rolling surface giving a ribbed appearance from the air.

2. In the Antarctic, the sea ice term ""ice island"" refers to a grounded part of a floating ice sheet which rises significantly higher than its surroundings, eg Butler Island. There are also more substantial features, eg the Lyddan Ice Rise."				no term available; sublcass of floating ice in envo

			hail	calving	"All of these terms refer to roughly the same process, its source (calving glacier) or its results (calved ice); however, 
1. some definitions assume that calving can only happen into water while others allow calving on land 
2. some definitions allow calving to occur from any form of ice of land origin, while others restrict it to glaciers or some subset of all of the types of ice of land origin 

Whether several definitions are needed or whether the community will accept a general inclusive definition is the question. In any case, it should be recognized that calving is an ablative process that results in icebergs if calving into water. What ice calved onto land would be called is not obvious, especially since the only definition of calved ice excludes ice falling onto land. 

Whatever decisions are made need to be consistent across all related terms."	A process during which a part of an ice mass breaks away from the main mass.			http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01000917																					
			http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_00000456	Tidewater glacier	"A glacier that terminates in a lake or the sea, with terminus either floating or grounded. The adjective indicates geographical setting, and not that tides play a role in the mass balance. Typically, tidewater glaciers calve ice to produce icebergs."			Yes	Whether or not a tidewater glacier has to have a grounded terminus and whether a terminus ending in a lake still counts as a tidewater glacier.																					
				tongue	"There are really two definitions here: 

One about the end of a glacier on land - this definition has nothing to do with winds or currents 

The second about a glacier or ice stream that ends in water (either sea water or a lake) where winds and currents elongate the end of the glacier. Suggest that the first definition actually could apply to all glaciers and the second adds water terminated glacier specifics."

	http://sweetontology.net/realmCryo/IceStream	Class			"1. A part of an ice sheet or ice cap with strongly enhanced flow which is not necessarily in the same direction as the flow in the surrounding ice, often separated from surrounding ice by strongly sheared, crevassed margins or margins that are sometimes clearly marked by a change in direction of the surface slope but which otherwise may be indistinct. 'Pure' ice streams are bounded by ice on either side and lack significant non-glacial topographic control, while 'topographic' ice streams are constrained by the topography. An ice stream of the latter type is similar to an outlet glacier, but outlet glaciers do not necessarily have strongly enhanced flow velocity.   Motion of an ice stream is dominated by basal sliding.

2. In glaciology, an ice stream may also refer to the confluent sections of a branched-valley glacier 

3. An obsolete synonym of valley glacier."																									
			ice cap	ice cap	"A dome-shaped mass of glacier ice that spreads out in all directions; an ice cap is usually larger than an icefield but less than 50,000 square-kilometers (12 million acres). It is generally considered improper to refer to the Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets as ice caps. 

The flow pattern is less influenced by the subsurface topography than is true of icefields and valley glaciers. The definition embraces small as well as large ice bodies. The usage '(polar) ice cap' for the sea ice cover of the Arctic Ocean or Southern Ocean is confusing and best avoided."

	http://sweetontology.net/realmCryo/Iceberg	Class	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01001546		"A piece of ice of greatly varying shape, usually protruding more than 5 m above water-level and with typical extents from tens of meters to many tens of kilometres across.  They have broken away from a glacier or ice shelf and may be either afloat or aground. The greater part of an iceberg's mass (4/5 to 8/9) is below sea level which makes them dangerous to shipping in high and mid-latitude regions of the ocean.

Icebergs may be described as tabular, dome-shaped, sloping, pinnacled, dry-docked, blocky, weathered or glacier bergs in addition to having a size qualifier. Icebergs are not sea ice, when they melt they add fresh water to the ocean.  The unmodified term ""iceberg"" usually refers to the irregular masses of ice formed by the calving of glaciers along an orographically rough coast, whereas tabular icebergs and ice islands are calved from an ice shelf, while bergs formed from sea ice are called floebergs. In decreasing size, they are classified as: ice island (few thousand square meters to 500 km^2 in area); tabular iceberg; iceberg; bergy bit (less than 5 m above sea level, between 1 and 200 m^2 in area); and growler (less than 1 m above sea level, about 20 m^2 in area).

Alaskan icebergs rarely exceed 500 feet in maximum dimension.  Antarctic icebergs originate from the ice mass of the Antarctic continent that has accumulated over many thousands of years. "	"An ice mass which has broken away from a larger ice mass on land, such as a glacier or ice shelf, and may be either afloat or aground."		yes	"should there be a quality term for ""tabular, dome-shaped, sloping, pinnacled, dry-docked, blocky, weathered or glacier bergs""?"

				bergy bit	"A piece of floating ice, generally less than 5 m above sea level and not more than about to m across. It is generally of glacier ice, but may be a massive piece of sea ice or disrupted hummocked ice."				subclass of iceberg																					
				growler	"Sea ice terminology that describes a piece of ice smaller than a bergy bit that floats with less than 1 meter (3.3 feet) showing above water, often almost awash. A growler generally appears white but sometimes transparent or blue-green or nearly black in colour. Normally occupying an area of about 20 square meters, growlers are difficult to distinguish when surrounded by sea ice or in high seas. Growlers are usually a fragment of an iceberg or floeberg and its surface often is heavily pitted. "				subclass of iceberg																					
			http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01001537	sea ice hummock	"Sea ice terminology, indicating a conglomeration of broken ice formed by pressure at the point of contact between ice floes; it may be fresh or weathered. The weathering of hummocks is similar to young mountain peaks with steep slopes that erode into smooth, rolling hills, in this case during the summer melt season.  The submerged volume of broken ice under the hummock, forced downwards by pressure, is termed a bummock.

	http://sweetontology.net/realmCryo/LandIce	Class	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01001547	Land ice mass	"Land ice is any part of the earth's seasonal or perennial ice cover that has formed over land as the result, principally, of the freezing of precipitation; opposed to sea ice formed by the freezing of seawater.  Thus, an iceberg or tabular iceberg is land ice as well as its parent glacier, ice sheet, or ice shelf. The two major concentrations of land ice are the ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica. Glaciers and ice caps are the other important forms."			yes

	http://sweetontology.net/realmCryo/Lead	Class			"In sea ice terminology, a lead is any fracture or passage-way through sea ice which is navigable by surface vessels. A more general description of a lead is an area of open water or new ice between ice floes, although the term is generally applied to linear features. If the open area is very large it may be called a polynya. Leads develop as ice diverges, or pulls apart. A lead between the shore and the pack ice is called a coastal lead or shore lead, and a lead between the fast ice and the pack ice is called a flaw lead.  At below freezing temperatures, new, nilas and young ice forms at the surface of leads. From the point of view of the submariner, a recently frozen lead is an ice skylight."			yes

	http://sweetontology.net/realmCryo/PackIce	Class			"1) Pre-2014 Pack ice definitions state that it is ice that is not attached to the shoreline and drifts in response to winds, currents, and other forces.  Pack ice can be described as very open (with an ice concentration of 1/10 to 3/10), open (4/10 to 6/10, with many leads and polynyas and the floes generally not in contact with one another), close (7/10 to 8/10, composed of floes mostly in contact), very close (9/10 to less than 10/10), and compact (10/10, with no water visible, called consolidated pack ice if the floes are frozen together).

Has synonym drift ice.

2) Post-2014 Term used in a wide sense to include any area of sea ice other than fast ice with concentrations that are high, i.e. 7/10 or more,"			yes	"The meaning of the term pack ice has changed over time. Per the 2014 WMO Sea Ice Nomenclature the definition now is: ""Drift Ice/Pack Ice: Term used in a wide sense to include any area of sea ice other than fast ice no matter what form it takes or how it is disposed. When concentrations are high, i.e. 7/10 or more, drift ice may be replaced by the term pack ice*.

 *Note: Previously the term pack ice was used for all ranges of concentration."" To me this implies that probably the term has been used with both definitions over time, so to ensure proper inference two definitions are needed, each with its own permalink. However, it isn't obvious what, other than date of writing, can be used to distinguish which definition is meant."																					
																														
	http://sweetontology.net/realmCryo/SeaIce	Class			"1. In general usage, sea ice is any ice found floating in the sea. 

2. In sea ice operations however, sea ice is any form of ice found at sea which has originated from the freezing of sea water.  It presents the main kind of floating ice encountered at sea. Except where it forms ridges, sea ice is up to a few metres thick, in which respect it differs from shelf ice.  Sea ice may be discontinuous pieces (ice floes) moved on the ocean surface by wind and currents (pack ice), or a motionless sheet attached to the coast (land-fast ice). In brief, it forms first as lolly ice (frazil crystals), thickens into sludge, and coagulates into sheet ice, pancake ice, or into floes of various shapes and sizes. Thereafter, sea ice may develop into pack ice and/or become a form of pressure ice.  Sea ice less than one year old is called first-year ice. Perennial ice is sea ice that survives at least one summer. It may be subdivided into second-year ice and multi-year ice, where multiyear ice has survived at least two summers.

3. In the United States, NOAA sea ice operations does not include superstructure icing as being sea ice.  In addition, they do count ice formed from the freezing of the waters of the Great Lakes as being the same as sea ice."			yes	Need to check alignments in ENVO for these terms since we re-classified this in ENVO on 2/27/2019
